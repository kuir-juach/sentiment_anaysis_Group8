# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project contains implementations of sentiment analysis using both deep learning and traditional machine learning models. Below are the details for each component of the project.

## Components

### 1. `sentiment_analysis_DL`
This directory contains the deep learning model for sentiment analysis. 

**Instructions:**
- Load the dataset from Kaggle: [Yelp Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/data).
- If using Google Colab, you can upload the dataset to your Google Drive and mount it in your Colab notebook to access the data.

### 2. `sentiment_analysis_TRAD`
This directory contains the traditional machine learning model for sentiment analysis.

**Instructions:**
- Load the dataset from Kaggle: [Yelp Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/data).
- If using Google Colab, upload the dataset to your Google Drive and mount it in your Colab notebook to access the data.

### 3. `sentiment_analysis_preprocessed`
This directory contains the preprocessing steps for the data used in both models.

**Instructions:**
- Load the dataset from Kaggle: [Yelp Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/data).
- If using Google Colab, upload the dataset to your Google Drive and mount it in your Colab notebook to access the data.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that your environment is set up correctly with Python and Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Adjust any paths in the scripts as necessary to match your local setup.
